# Corpus Soldatenbriefe (1745–1872)

The corpus "Soldiers' Letters" comprises 170 letters from officers,
non-commissioned officers and ordinary soldiers, addressed to their
families back home. While all letters are written in German in the
period from 1745 to 1872, there is a clear focus on letters from the
Coalition and Liberation Wars (1792–1815), the German War (1866) and
the Franco-Prussian War (1870/71). Although the reasons for writing
are largely the same, the writing experience of the three rank groups
(officer, non-commissioned officer, enlisted men and common soldier)
is very different. The corpus thus offers the possibility of examining
the entire breadth of historical everyday writing on the basis of a
single type of letter.

The corpus “Soldatenbriefe des 18. und 19. Jahrhunderts” has been
curated and published in the context of [Text+](https://www.text-plus.org/).
